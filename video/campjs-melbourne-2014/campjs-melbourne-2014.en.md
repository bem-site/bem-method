### Abstract

Introducing BEM Block Libraries — a set of blocks build on top of same ideas that inspired Web Components creators but long long time ago. Being developed in 2008 by Yandex, Russian Search Engine, they are very helpful in building websites fast and flexible. Why so? Because of the years of experience put in them while working in large rapidly changing services.

Unfortunately it is very well known only here in Russia and ex-Soviet countries, where, thanks to Harry Roberts and Nicolas Gallagher, so-called BEM CSS is spread far ahead in the rest of the world. With this talk we aim to share what we have in BEM Methodology to cover JS coding with and introduce Australian developers to a new chapter in BEM, partly not always easy to understand, open-sourced and handy for maintaining complexity of web development you could grow in.
