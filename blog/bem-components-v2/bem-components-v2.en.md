## Blocks

## Levels

Different types of redefinition level allow our library to operate correctly at full strength on different [platforms](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/#levels).

Such levels of differentiation allow you to cut off the desktop-oriented files during the build procedure when you develop an application only for touch devices and vice versa.

## Cross-browser compatibility

bem-components library supports all upcoming [browser versions](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/#supported-browsers), including Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, Yandex и Internet Explorer.

## Library delivery cases

We offer you three types of bem-components library delivery.

### Source

Used for technically identical projects that use the same preprocessor and template engine. For more information about tools and technologies see the [description](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2/) of the library. 

We recommend you to use source method. The easiest way to start with it is to use a [project-stub](https://github.com/bem/project-stub) or BEM [project generator](https://en.bem.info/tools/bem/bem-stub/) based on `yo`. Both of them already contain of bem-components v2.0.0 library.

### Compiled

Used for the projects that do not use any preprocessor or use other than Stylus.

To get the compiled version of the library, download the [source code](https://github.com/bem/bem-components/tree/v2.0.0) of bem-components library, install npm dependencies, and run `npm run compiled` command in the root directory.

### Library

Used to connect bem-components library as a readymade library with the possibility to link  components as JS or CSS bundles to the page.
To get the readymade library, you should download the [source code](https://github.com/bem/bem-components/tree/v2.0.0) of bem-components, install npm dependencies, and run `npm run dist` command in the root directory. 

Now you will be able to see the result within the `./dist/` directory.

## Compatibility and stable build

Developers using the library way before the release should know that the code base was ready to use for a long time. 

Before announcing v2.0.0 we wanted to test it in the real world, cover all use case scenarios, and write detailed documentation for all blocks in two languages. 

Now, we can say — bem-components v2.0.0 is a stable version. And it could be used for a wide range of tasks on projects of all sizes with no risk.

One more good news: bem-components library uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/lang/ru/). Now, you could use corresponding tags instead of definite commit number.

All future updates of the library will be more transparent and understandable. 

From now on you may check two information sources – [semantic versioning] (http://semver.org/lang/en/) and a changelog file with detailed description of all changes. It will definitely give you a picture of all new features and compatibility between different versions.

We would love to hear your stories about [bem-components v2.0.0](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-components/v2.0.0/) library usage in the ”wild“, meaning – in your projects :) 

We welcome all your questions and experience notes on our [forum](https://en.bem.info/forum/). Please don’t forget to mark your posts about the library with the [bem-components](https://en.bem.info/forum/?labels=bem-components) label.

Your user feedback and active contribution to the library helps us to improve our library and extend it with new helpful blocks and features. 

Enjoy the update and use!
