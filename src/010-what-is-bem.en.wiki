=== What is BEM?

BEM is an approach to front-end development designed with flexibility and ease of modification in mind.

BEM helps solve the following problems:

 * separation of project's codebase into logical parts:
    * separation of responsibilities between developers of different specialization;
    * high-level abstractions - BEM technologies can be used without deep understanding of their internal workings;
    * ease of reuse - BEM consists of a large number of loosely coupled components which can be used - and reused - independently.
 * a singular approach to implementation of parts of the web stack written in different programming languages:
    * web applications are written in multiple programming and markup languages - it is possible to develop with all of them using the same set of terms and approaches;
    * images and documentation are treated as "technologies" too.
 * optimization of the production runtime:
    * build the production runtime with components that are actually being used;
    * generate browser-specific production runtimes;
    * performance improvements are possible by improving not only the application code, but the "compiler" itself.
