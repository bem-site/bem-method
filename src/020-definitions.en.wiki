=== Definitions
==== Block
Block is an independent entity, a building block of an application.\\
Blocks contain information about themselves and their children (block elements).\\
Blocks can be used on their own or as a part of other blocks.

**Example**\\
##b-search## - a search form block\\
%%html
<img src="/bem-method/images/search.ru.png"/>
%%

==== Element
Element is a part of block that performs a certain function.\\
Block elements can only appear inside their respective blocks. Elements can be mandatory or optional.

**Example**\\
An input field and a button are elements of the ##b-search## block\\
%%html
<img src="/bem-method/images/search-e.ru.png"/>
%%

==== Modifier
Modifiers are properties of blocks and elements, they change appearance or behavior of the elements they're applied to.\\
Each modifier has a name and a value. Multiple modifiers can be applied simultaneously.

**Example**\\
A ##b-search## block modifier sets the block's background color//
%%html

%%

==== Overloading
A project can consist of several sets of block implementations. Each set, or level, extends the higher-level set. The final implementation of a block is assembled by building the levels sequentially.

**Example**\\
%%html
<img src="/bem-method/images/levels.ru.png"/>
