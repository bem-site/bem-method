[Github repo](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/) of `bem-core`.

## bem-bl

[bem-bl](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-bl/) is an extended library that consists not only of basic blocks but also of a number of generic solutions for displaying a menu, text, logo, search tab, table and so on.

On a current state of development, `bem-bl` is suspended and will not be replenished with new blocks, however we provide a user support and bug fixing. We recommend you to start new projects using `bem-core` instead. Differences between `bem-core` and `bem-bl` are described in a [migration guide](https://en.bem.info/libs/bem-core/current/migration/).
