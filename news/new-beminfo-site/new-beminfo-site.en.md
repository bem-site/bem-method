# Brand new bem.info with node.js and bemtree inside

Today we launched brand new [bem.info](http://bem.info).
We consider this launch as technologic, important and very much awaited by us as a team. However, we already have a lot in mind to improve!
New in it: we reconsidered our design, tried to sort out the content including small bug-fixes such as adding a date for a publication or the day it was changed, changed server side stack for node.js and bemtree (async declarative templates written in BEM terms) that ode day allows us moving fast forward and adding in perspective different types of useful functionality.

In progress: proof-reading of the content including translating it into English, updating the whole bunch of documentation and filling the missing parts. And these are only a tiny piece of a plan we have in mind for this and the next years.

We hope very much for your help in bem.info site development. Because most of all we coded was for you, our BEM-community, developers that uses and who are interested in our BEM stack of technologies. We are ready and want very much to make our site as useful as possible to cut the time you spend on getting useful information and fill in the gaps and missing parts you need the most.

Feel free to send all bug reports, suggestions and feature requests to [info@bem.info](mailto:info@bem.info).

Kudos go to our great site development team: [Andrew Kuznetsov](https://github.com/tormozz48/), [Aleksandra Nekhaieva](https://github.com/lesanra), [Pavel Bashinsky](http://bem.info/authors/bashinsky-pavel/), [Danila Kovchiy](https://twitter.com/kovchiy) and [Vladimir Grinenko](http://bem.info/authors/grinenko-vladimir/).
