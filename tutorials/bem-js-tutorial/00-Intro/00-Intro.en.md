# Tutorial on JavaScript in BEM terms

One of the key issues of the BEM stack, the [bem-core
library](https://github.com/bem/bem-core) provides
[i-bem](https://github.com/bem/bem-core/tree/v1/common.blocks/i-bem) block among others.
It is often called a helper block since it's used to build other blocks and
empowers them with BEM features.

The `i-bem` block is implemented using a variety of technologies, including JavaScript,
which provides the framework for coding in BEM terms.

This tutorial details how to use `i-bem` features for JavaScript in your
components.
